It extends the LangChain library, allowing you to coordinate multiple chains (or actors) across multiple steps of computation in a cyclic manner. In this article, we‚Äôll introduce LangGraph, walk you through its basic concepts, and share some insights and common points of confusion for beginners.\\nWhat is LangGraph? [...] LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain, designed to add cyclic computational capabilities to your LLM applications. While LangChain allows you to define chains of computation (Directed Acyclic Graphs or DAGs), LangGraph introduces the ability to add cycles, enabling more complex, agent-like behaviors where you can call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next.\\nKey Concepts\\nA Simple Example [...] LangGraph is a versatile tool for building complex, stateful applications with LLMs. By understanding its core concepts and working through simple examples, beginners can start to leverage its power for their projects. Remember to pay attention to state management, conditional edges, and ensuring there are no dead-end nodes in your graph. Happy coding!\\n--\\n--\\n9\\nWritten by CPlog',\n",
